## Documentation
Documentation of FXComponents can be found in this link: **[insert link of documentation page]**. You should check it
if you want to know more about this library.

## How to get it
You can download the jar from the [releases tab](https://github.com/dukke/FXComponents/releases) or get it through
Maven Central.

Here are examples for Gradle and Maven (replace version number with the version you want):

**[below is just a placeholder, library not yet in maven central]**

#### Gradle

implementation 'com.pixelduke:FXComponents:1.0.0'
```

## Source code
The FXComponents-samples subproject has samples that you can run and check out how to use FXComponents.

The code is being compiled on Java 11 and JavaFX 11. However, it should work on the latest Java and JavaFX version.

## Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because, for instance, might be outside the intended scope of the project.

### Filing bugs
When filing bugs it's most often good practice to attach a small sample app (as small, simple and with the fewest lines of code as possible). This app when executed, should show the bug happening.  
The reason for this is the limited amount of resources and time I have and also because in the process of filing a bug, developers sometimes discover that the bug isn't in the library but somewhere else.   
Without a small example app the issue might be closed prematurely.

## Feedback request
Please send pictures of your application that is using this library, or a site that shows your application. Or share it through Twitter (you can reference
me through my twitter handle @P_Duke if you'd like).   
This is very important for me to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly to make this library better.
Also, and if you allow it, to showcase example uses.    
Seeing this library get used also always motivates me to keep working on it.
